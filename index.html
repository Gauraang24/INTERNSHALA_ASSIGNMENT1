          <h2>Atomic Habits</h2>
          <p>
            How many times have you tried to adopt good habits, like waking up
            early, going to the gym, or eating healthy, only to lose motivation
            shortly after starting?
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost every time, right? Atomic Habits is a book used by many to
            help them adopt good habits and break bad ones in order to live a
            better life. This book provides a comprehensive guide on how to
            build good habits and break bad ones. The main focus of this book is
            on small changes that can lead to remarkable results over time.

          <p>There are basically four concepts listed in this book:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cue: It acts as a trigger for your habit.</li>
            <li>
              Craving: After the cue, follows the craving, which represents the
              desire for the reward associated with the habit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Response: Response is the behavior or action we do in response to
              the cue and craving, constituting the habit itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reward: Also known as dopamine hits, a chemical released by your
              brain which makes you satisfied for completing the loop and
              increasing the likelihood of habit repetition.
            </li>

          <h2>Rich Dad Poor Dad</h2>
          <p>
            Rich Dad Poor Dad written by Robert Kiyosaki is a personal finance
            classic that contrasts the financial philosophies of the author's
            "rich dad" and "poor dad." Kiyosaki shares valuable lessons on
            wealth building and financial literacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Robert Kiyosaki tells us in his book how his 2 dads, Rich Dad and
            Poor Dad, were different in the way they look at money and how it
            helped him to improve his financial condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of us belong to the middle-class society, and often our parents
            aren't capable of shaping ourselves to be good at the most important
            part of everybody's life, that is
            <strong>"FINANCIAL STABILITY"</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think all of you should go through this book once in a life; it'll
            help you change your perspective about money, teach you how to grow
            assets and reduce liability, and most importantly, live your dream
            life the way you want to be.

          <p>Key Takeaways :</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The wealthy/rich don't work for money the way poor people do;
              rather they make their money work for them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rich people get wealthy by acquiring assets which generate money
              over time, such as Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the long run, it does not matter how much money you make; how
              much you save is all that matters.
            </li>
            <li>Take Calculative Financial Risks: No Risk, No Reward.</li>
            <li>
              Your Mind is your single most valuable asset. Make proper use of
              it.
            </li>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey myself Gaurang More, and I'm a big fan of books that teach me
          something new. I've made this blog to share what I learn from those
          books with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work almost 10-11 hours each day in my company, so books help me to
          switch myself off after a day full of chaos. This blog/project is a
          way for me to connect with like-minded people who enjoy reading the
          same way as I do. But even if you're not into reading books, or don't
          have time to go through a whole book, you can read summaries given by
          me in this blog. I promise you that it won't be more than 5 mins.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope my summaries and tips will inspire you to pick up a book and
          start your own reading adventure!
